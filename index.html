            <p>
                I’ve always believed in earning things the right way. I worked my way through school by doing custom framing at Jo‑Ann Fabrics, 
                then built a career in the insurance world where I became the youngest in my department to earn a CPCU. When the company needed 
                help in accounting, I stepped in and made that role my home for the last several years.

                That mix of hands‑on craftsmanship, financial discipline, and long‑term commitment is what I bring into this business. 
                I run the shop with the same mindset I’ve carried my whole life: respect the details, stay organized, and build things 
                that actually make people’s lives easier.

                    I handle the business, numbers, and quality standards. Product development is supported by access to real engineering 
                    and manufacturing experience, so ideas can move from concept to physical prototypes with intention and accuracy. 
                    Together, that combination lets us build products that are practical, reliable, and designed with real users in mind.
